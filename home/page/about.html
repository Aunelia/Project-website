          <h3>About me</h3>
          <p>
            Hi, my name is Aunelia. I'm 28 years old. I live in the
            Pas-de-Calais. <br />
            I have a rather dynamic and brilliant personality, my life is far
            from a straight line.<br /><br />
            When I was a kid, I dreamed of college, thinking that if I set foot
            in it, I could succeed, in fact, school was a pain to me. After many
            difficulties, I enrolled in university to realize my dream as a
            child, but that dream soon turned into disappointment.<br /><br />
            My dream came true, I wanted to achieve another one: to leave, and
            at that time I was very hesitant between Australia and Canada. The
            rain of spiders strengthened my choice for Canada.<br />
            After a PVT and a job by Barista, badly paid and mentally tired, at
            the end of my PVT I had to return to France to renew my permit. At
            the time, I intended to study as DEVOPS in a private school in
            Montreal with my loan approved by a bank in France. Except, Covid, I
            couldn't leave, I was stuck in France, so I had to make replacements
            for cleaning. End of COVID, the bank didn't want to lend any more
            money. <br />
            So I decided to wait and find a solution and before I ended up
            completely crazy, I took a Community Manager course, and I loved
            making a website, it was under wordpress. From that point on, I
            thought, "Come on, let's try to sign up for a web training, you
            never know?" And I loved it.<br />
            I love Python. You're gonna tell me normal, it's simple, for me,
            with that language, you can all do technically, it's probably the
            one I'll get the least tired of, and with which my creative side
            could be the best, so maybe I'm wrong, But I look forward to working
            with people who teach me other things and ask me or ask me my
            choice.<br />
            I've always made my dreams come true and I hope to continue. Maybe
            with your help, who knows?<br />
