<h3>About me</h3> 
<p> My name is Aunelia, I am currently 28 years old, I live in the middle of northern France, I am currently in training in web development and also i validated training as a community manager.. <br>
  I like a lot of things, whether it's Asia, reading, music, games, food. I also like money very much. <br>
  I have a strong personality, I fight for what I want. <br> <br>
  " If the path is too easy, it's the wrong " ~ One piece. <br><br>
I'd really like to learn from someone, even though the path I've chosen is going to be very hard, I want to succeed, I don't give myself a choice. <br>
  I was born on November 04th, 1994, already 4th is bad luck in some parts of the world, November 04th is also the day of the discovery of Tutankhamun. <br>
  Other fun things, at one minute ready I was scorpion climbing scorpion and moon sign scorpion. For the Chinese sign it's a wooden dog, my blood type A+, and my personality type is ENTJ-A. <br>
  My first name is a very ancient Latin name and extremely rare, Onelia is Spanish, but the Au is Germanic. <br>
